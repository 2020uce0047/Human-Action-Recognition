**Human Action Recognition with LRCN Model using PyTorch**

This repository hosts a comprehensive project on Human Action Recognition, featuring a state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) model implemented with the PyTorch framework. The model has been meticulously trained and evaluated to recognize five distinct human action classes, namely "PushUps", "Diving", "JavelinThrow", "Skijet" and "VolleyballSpiking" utilizing the UCF50 dataset.
